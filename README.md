# Nikki's Union
## Problem Statement
Today it is very hard or impossible to send money transafers between certain countries (e.g. from Russia to US). Before the transfer goes through (*if it goes through*) you are required to fill out countless forms with high processing times. Using Western Union international money transfers is incovinient as well, since you are subject to high comission fees and you can only send limited amounts. This project will attempt to solve this issue by enabling regular users to send money internationally with low comission (as opposed to [Ripple](https://ripple.com/), which uses a B2B model). 
## Workflow
Let's go through the workflow using a concrete example. Alice who is located in Russia wants to send $500 to Bob, who is located in the US.
Setup:
1. We have an account with crypto exchange supported in Russia with 0xabc Ethereum address
2. We have an account with crypto exchange supported in US with 0xdef Ethereum address

Actual workflow:
1. Alice goes in the web UI and submits a request to transfer $500 to Bob.
